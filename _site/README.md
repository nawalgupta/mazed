# MazedGame
Mazed is an endless maze styled game, where there are 3 main type of maze (simple, platform and shooter styles). The game has it base on its procedural generation and the only way to beat it is to play it enough to get to a map size so big that you device canâ€™t handle it (there is no size cap, the map increases as you play it, so if you play enough it eventually will be impossible to move).
